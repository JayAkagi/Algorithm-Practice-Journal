# 🧠 Algorithm Practice (Java)

## Overview
This repository is a **personal algorithm and problem-solving practice log** written in Java.

The focus is intentionally on **thinking in code first**, not optimisation.

Before worrying about performance, the goal is to build the ability to:
- Break problems down logically  
- Translate ideas into working Java code  
- Develop strong problem-solving instincts  

Once that foundation is solid, solutions will be revisited and improved.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Train algorithmic thinking  
- Improve logic and reasoning through repetition  
- Become fluent at expressing solutions in Java  
- Build confidence before focusing on optimisation  

Big-O analysis and performance tuning come **after** correctness and clarity.

## 📌 What This Repo Is (and Isn’t)

### ✅ This repo **is**
- A learning playground  
- A record of progress over time  
- A place to write imperfect but honest solutions  

### ❌ This repo is **not**
- A collection of optimal solutions  
- Production-ready code  
- A showcase of polished implementations  

Early solutions may be brute-force, verbose, or inefficient by design.

## 🗂️ Topics Covered

Problems may include (but are not limited to):
- Arrays & Strings  
- Loops and conditionals  
- Basic recursion  
- Hashing  
- Introductory data structures  

More advanced topics will be added as complexity increases.

---

## 🔁 Iteration Philosophy

Some problems may be solved multiple times:
1. First pass focuses on **getting it working**
2. Later passes improve:
   - Readability
   - Structure
   - Time and space complexity

Progress matters more than perfection.

## ⚠️ Notes

- Optimisation is **not** the initial priority  
- Solutions may change over time  
- Code quality will evolve as understanding improves  

This repository documents the learning process, not the end result.

## 📈 Why This Exists

The goal is simple:

> **Think clearly ➡️ Code confidently ➡️ Optimise later ➡️ Grow as a Developer 👨🏽‍💻**
