# 🧠 Algorithm Practice (Java)

## Overview
This repository is a **personal algorithm and problem-solving journal** written in Java.

The priority is **thinking and get comfortable in code then optimisation**.

The focus is on:
- Breaking problems down logically
- Translating intent into correct Java code
- Building calm, repeatable problem-solving habits

Performance, Big-O analysis, and optimisation are layered in **after correctness**.

---

## 🎯 Training Goals

- Build strong algorithmic thinking through repetition
- Develop clean, readable Java solutions
- Gain confidence solving problems without shortcuts
- Learn patterns before optimising them

Correctness and clarity come first. Speed comes later.

---

## 📌 Scope & Intent

### What this repository **is**
- A learning workspace
- A record of growth over time
- A place for imperfect, exploratory solutions

### What this repository **is not**
- A showcase of optimal solutions
- Production-ready code
- A memorisation exercise

Early solutions may be verbose or inefficient by design.

## 🗺️ DSA Roadmap & Progress

This roadmap outlines the **intended progression** of topics.
Each tier may be revisited and refactored as understanding improves.

### Status Legend
- **Completed** – Problems implemented and understood
- **In Progress** – Actively practicing / partial coverage
- **Planned** – Not started yet
- **Refactor Pending** – Correct but due for cleanup or optimisation

---

- Tree traversals (DFS / BFS)  
- Height and depth  
- Diameter of a tree  
- Lowest common ancestor  
- Validate binary search tree  

---

### Tier 7 — Graphs
**Status:** ⏳ Planned  
**Focus:** Non-linear traversal

**Exercises**
- BFS / DFS  
- Connected components

**Status:** ⏳ Planned  
**Focus:** Problem decomposition

**Exercises**
- Fibonacci (memoization & tabulation)  
- Knapsack variants  
- Coin change  
- Longest increasing subsequence  
- Grid path problems  

---

## 🔁 Iteration Philosophy

Problems may be solved multiple times:

1. First pass: make it work
2. Later passes: improve
   - Structure
   - Readability
   - Time and space efficiency

---

## ⚠️ Working Principles

- Optimisation is not the initial goal
- Solutions evolve over time
- Earlier code will look worse than later code — that’s expected

This repository documents **learning**, not outcomes.

> **Think clearly → Code confidently → Optimise later**
