## Tier 2 — Pattern Recognition (Strings & Controlled Traversal) 🧠

### Focus
I’m training:
- Pointer control
- Character-level reasoning
- Clean, readable logic

The goal is to understand what the code is doing at every step, not to compress it into one-liners.

## What This Code Represents

This file is my practice ground for **common** string problems that show up everywhere.

I work directly with:
- Character arrays
- Index movement from both ends
- Basic data structures when memory helps clarity

---

## Implemented Exercises

### Reverse String 🔄

I reverse a string by converting it into a character array and swapping from the outside inward.

This forces me to:
- Think in symmetric positions
- Respect boundaries
- Avoid hidden magic from library methods

The logic mirrors array reversal and reinforces the same mental model.

---

### Palindrome Check 🪞

I check whether a string is a palindrome by walking inward from both ends.

I compare characters directly and stop the moment they don’t match.

I also normalize case so I’m comparing meaning, not formatting.

This trains:
- Two-pointer control
- Early exits
- Confidence in simple logic

---

### First Repeating Character 🔁

I track characters I’ve already seen using a set.

As I move through the string:
- If I see a character twice, I stop
- If not, I mark it and keep going

---

### Count Vowels 🧮

I count vowels by scanning the string once and recording occurrences in a map.

I separate the problem into two steps:
1. Identify what matters
2. Present the result clearly

---

## Rules I’m Following 📌

- I write solutions that are easy to reason about
- I don’t hide logic inside library calls
- I accept verbosity when it improves understanding
- I revisit and refine later, not immediately

This file is not about finishing fast.  
It’s about building trust in my thinking.

## Mindset

Strings are just arrays with opinions.

Once I can move through characters calmly and predictably, the problems stop feeling random.

I’m not memorizing solutions.  
I’m building patterns.
